# Wakala Transaction Monitoring Web Backend
The **Wakala Transaction Monitoring Web Backend** is a Laravel-based system designed to track and manage mobile money transactions for Wakala agents. It processes SMS messages from multiple Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), including **M-Pesa, Airtel Money, Halotel, TTCL, and Tigo Pesa**, extracting key details such as deposits, withdrawals, commissions, and float balances. The backend provides **secure REST APIs** for mobile(wakala-app) and web frontend application (wakala-client), ensuring seamless transaction tracking, user authentication, and real-time reporting.  

The system is deployed on **Laravel Cloud** and database used is **MongoDB**, leveraging **Laravel Queues and Laravel Sanctum** for authentication and performance optimization. It supports **offline data synchronization**, allowing transactions to be stored locally on the mobile app and synced when an internet connection is available. With its **scalable infrastructure and secure API architecture**, the backend ensures Wakala agents have reliable access to their transaction data anytime. ðŸš€
